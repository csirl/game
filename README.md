# CSIRL (Counter Strike In Real Life)
CSIRL is meant to be played as a real life version of Counter Strike. This game is played by two teams using Nerf, Laser Tag, or similar weapons. Best played in a large building or area.

This game only focuses on DE style maps, Bomb Defusal & Arsenal Demolition. As such the game includes a virtual reality bomb that must be planted in a target zone. Once armed the bomb can be defused by the counter terrorist team to win. The game also allows for bomb drops (person holding the bomb is killed), as well as the event of the entire team is killed before a bomb is planted.
